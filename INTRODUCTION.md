## 💡 Key Features Explained

### 1. AI-Powered Automatic Coding

**What it does**: Analyzes text and generates codes automatically

**How it works**:
1. You provide interview transcript or field notes
2. Select methodology (e.g., Grounded Theory)
3. QualAI applies coding principles from methodology
4. Generates codes with definitions and examples
5. Stores in knowledge graph for further analysis

**Example**:
```
Input: "I felt overwhelmed when starting the new software.
        The interface was confusing and I couldn't find basic features."

QualAI Output:
- "user-frustration" - Emotional response to software
- "interface-complexity" - UI design challenges
- "onboarding-difficulty" - Learning curve issues
- "feature-discoverability" - Problems finding functions
```

### 2. Community Methodology Library

**What it is**: GitHub-based repository of qualitative research methodologies

**How it works**:
- Researchers contribute methodologies as JSON files
- RAG system enables semantic search
- Each methodology includes stages, guidance, and quality criteria
- Community ratings and usage statistics

**Current Methodologies**:
1. **Constructivist Grounded Theory** (Charmaz, 2014)
   - For theory-building from data
   - 4 stages: Initial coding → Focused coding → Theoretical coding → Memo writing

2. **Reflexive Thematic Analysis** (Braun & Clarke, 2006)
   - For pattern identification
   - 6 phases: Familiarization → Coding → Theme generation → Review → Define → Write-up

**Coming Soon**:
- Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA)
- Discourse Analysis
- Content Analysis
- Your methodology!

### 3. Knowledge Graph Storage

**What it is**: Structured database for all your research data

**What it stores**:
- **Projects**: Research projects with metadata
- **Participants**: Study participants
- **Data**: Interviews, observations, documents
- **Codes**: Coding labels with definitions
- **Themes**: Emergent themes from analysis
- **Memos**: Analytical memos and reflections
- **Relations**: Connections between all entities

**Benefits**:
- **Traceability**: Track every code to its source quote
- **Visualization**: See relationships between themes
- **Retrieval**: Fast full-text search across all data
- **Export**: Generate reports with supporting evidence

### 4. Saturation Detection

**What it does**: Determines when you have enough data

**How it works**:
- Analyzes code/theme emergence across data sources
- Calculates novelty rate for each new data source
- Provides saturation metrics at three levels:
  - **Code saturation**: No new codes emerging
  - **Theme saturation**: No new themes emerging
  - **Theoretical saturation**: No new theoretical insights

**Practical Value**:
- Know when to stop data collection
- Justify sample size methodologically
- Demonstrate rigor to reviewers

### 5. Negative Case Analysis

**What it does**: Finds data that contradicts your themes

**Why it matters**:
- Increases credibility of findings
- Refines theme definitions
- Identifies scope limitations
- Essential for trustworthiness

**Example**:
```
Theme: "Remote work increases productivity"

Negative Cases Found:
1. Participant 7: "I'm less productive at home due to distractions"
2. Participant 12: "My output decreased without office structure"

Refinement:
Theme → "Remote work productivity depends on home environment"
```
